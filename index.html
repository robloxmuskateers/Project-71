There are four houses at Hogwarts. A house is like your family at the school. You will do classes with them and share a commonroom with them. At the starting of your seven year education, you will be sorted into a house by the sorting hat. You will go home for the summer holidays, and the choice to go home during the winter holidays and easter holidays. You will attend classes every weekday to learn from some our teachers. The commonrooms for each of the houses are comfortable, ranging from the tallest tower to the deepest dungeon. In each commonroom, there will be multiple dormitories for each gender and year of education. 5 boys/girls will be in each dormitory respectivly, and all will be in the same year of education in each dormitory.</div>

                <p>The Philosopher's Stone, a substance created to make an elixer of life, making the drinker immortal. Every metal the stone touched turned to gold too. It was originally being held at Gringotts Bank, but the Headmaster of Hogwarts, Professor Dumbledore, thought the Stone was not safe there and had it brought to Hogwarts for safe-keeping. The same day it was extracted, there was a break-in at Gringotts, though nothing was taken. It looked as if the robber was looking for the Stone. Later in the year, the robber turned up, but the Stone was bravely protectod by a certain Mr. Harry Potter. Professor Dumbledore Arrived in time to kill the intruder and save eleven-year-old Harry, and the Stone was destroyed.</p>

                <p>Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardy was the host for the first Triwizard Tournament for a long time. The three schools competing were Beauxbatons, Durmstrang and, of course, Hogwarts. One representative from each scool was supposed to compete, but because of a mix up, two chapions were selected for Hogwarts by the Triwizard Cup. The two champions were Cedric Diggory, in his seventh year, and Harry Potter, in his fourth year. The champion for Beauxbatons was Fleur Delacouer, in her seventh, and for Durmstrang was a popular Victor Krum, also in his seventh. They all competed in three tasks, the first being dragons. They had to get a golden egg from a dragon nest, and all complied. The second task was to find the mer-people village in the black lake and save one of their friends. Mr. Potter ended up saving two of the four, since Fleur Delacour didn't show up. It seemed as she was pulled by a grindlyow, and was out for the task, there was no harm done to her or to any of the hostages. The final task was a hedge maze, and Harry and Cedric got to the cup first. After an unfortunate event, the return of Voldemort, Mr. DIggory suffered an early death. Harry Potter survived and brought his body back. Harry Ended up winning the tournament.</p>

They destoyed the first six in an endless hunt, and returned to Hogwarts, which was under the control of Voldemort himself, to face him. There was an epic battle where students and teachers alike fought to rid their school of the Death Eaters (Voldemort's followers). The final battle occured when Harry and Voldemort had a wand fight, and Mr. Potter fought and won. Voldemort perished, and Hogwarts, and the world, was freed.</p>

                    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy is pround to announce... We have a new Herbology teacher! Professor Sprout was too old to carry on the study and teaching of Herbology, so she passed her hat to none other than Neville Longbottom! The once-thought blundering fool has a gift in the study of magical flora, and is now teaching at Hogwarts. He was also the one who cut off Nagini's head (Voldemort's snake), getting rid of the last hocrux and allowing Harry Potter to finish Voldemort. This fact is rarely acknowledged, and Mr. Longbottom (now known as Proffessor Longbottom) does not care for it. He is truly gifted in Herbology, and we expect gifted students from his class.

                    A new student joined Hogwarts School of Wichcraft and Wizardy two years ago and is in his third year. He is known to cause trouble. One fateful day, Nearly Headless Nick, the Griffiondor Ghost, reported seeing a very valuable gold filing cabinet tuble down the main staircase into the entrance hall. When Nick looked, there was no one in sight, though he thought he heard faint footsteps. It looks as if James Poter has gotten hold of his father's invisibility cloak! *Chuckle* He, like his father and fathers before him, has fun playing pranks, especially on the teachers. This year, James' younger brother Albus Severus Potter joined Hogwarts, and like all his family, was put into Griffiondor. We must hope that Albus doesn't follow is brother!
